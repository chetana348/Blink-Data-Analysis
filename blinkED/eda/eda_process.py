def eda_process(eda_signal, sampling_rate=1000, method="neurokit", report=None, **kwargs):
    """**Process Electrodermal Activity (EDA)**

    Convenience function that automatically processes electrodermal activity (EDA) signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eda_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw EDA signal.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of ``"rsp_signal"`` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of ``"biosppy"`` or ``"neurokit"`` (default).
    report : str
        The filename of a report containing description and figures of processing
        (e.g. ``"myreport.html"``). Needs to be supplied if a report file
        should be generated. Defaults to ``None``. Can also be ``"text"`` to
        just print the text in the console without saving anything.
    **kwargs
        Other arguments to be passed to specific methods. For more information,
        see :func:`.rsp_methods`.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as ``"eda_signal"`` containing the following
        columns:

        * ``"EDA_Raw"``: the raw signal.

        * ``"EDA_Clean"``: the cleaned signal.

        * ``"EDA_Tonic"``: the tonic component of the signal, or the Tonic Skin Conductance Level
          (SCL).

        * ``"EDA_Phasic"``: the phasic component of the signal, or the Phasic Skin Conductance
          Response (SCR).

        * ``"SCR_Onsets"``: the samples at which the onsets of the peaks occur, marked as "1" in a
          list of zeros.

        * ``"SCR_Peaks"``: the samples at which the peaks occur, marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        * ``"SCR_Height"``: the SCR amplitude of the signal including the Tonic component. Note that
          cumulative effects of close-occurring SCRs might lead to an underestimation of the
          amplitude.

        * ``"SCR_Amplitude"``: the SCR amplitude of the signal excluding the Tonic component.

        * ``"SCR_RiseTime"``: the time taken for SCR onset to reach peak amplitude within the SCR.

        * ``"SCR_Recovery"``: the samples at which SCR peaks recover (decline) to half amplitude,
          marked  as "1" in a list of zeros.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the information of each SCR peak (see :func:`eda_findpeaks`),
        as well as the signals' sampling rate.
