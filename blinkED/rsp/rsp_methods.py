    """**RSP Preprocessing Methods**

    This function analyzes and specifies the methods used in the preprocessing, and create a
    textual description of the methods used. It is used by :func:`rsp_process()` to dispatch the
    correct methods to each subroutine of the pipeline and :func:`rsp_report()` to create a
    preprocessing report.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the raw RSP signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The method used for cleaning and peak finding if ``"method_cleaning"``
        and ``"method_peaks"`` are set to ``"default"``. Can be one of ``"Khodadad"``, ``"BioSPPy"``.
        Defaults to ``"Khodadad"``.
    method_cleaning: str
        The method used to clean the raw RSP signal. If ``"default"``,
        will be set to the value of ``"method"``. Defaults to ``"default"``.
        For more information, see the ``"method"`` argument
        of :func:`.rsp_clean`.
    method_peaks: str
        The method used to find peaks. If ``"default"``,
        will be set to the value of ``"method"``. Defaults to ``"default"``.
        For more information, see the ``"method"`` argument
        of :func:`.rsp_peaks`.
    method_rvt: str
        The method used to compute respiratory volume per time. Defaults to ``"harrison"``.
        For more information, see the ``"method"`` argument
        of :func:`.rsp_rvt`.
    **kwargs
        Other arguments to be passed to :func:`.rsp_clean`,
        :func:`.rsp_peaks`, and :func:`.rsp_rvt`.

    Returns
    -------
    report_info : dict
        A dictionary containing the keyword arguments passed to the cleaning
        and peak finding functions, text describing the methods, and the corresponding
        references.
