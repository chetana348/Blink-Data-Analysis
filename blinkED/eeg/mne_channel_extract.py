def mne_channel_extract(raw, what, name=None, add_firstsamples=False):
    """**Channel extraction from MNE objects**

    Select one or several channels by name and returns them in a dataframe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : mne.io.Raw
        Raw EEG data.
    what : str or list
        Can be ``"MEG"``, which will extract all MEG channels, ``"EEG"``, which will extract all EEG
        channels, or ``"EOG"``, which will extract all EOG channels (that is, if channel names are
        named with prefixes of their type e.g., 'EEG 001' etc. or 'EOG 061'). Provide exact a single
        or a list of channel's name(s) if not (e.g., ['124', '125']).
    name : str or list
        Useful only when extracting one channel. Can also take a list of names for renaming multiple channels,
        Otherwise, defaults to ``None``.
    add_firstsamples : bool
        Defaults to ``False``. MNE's objects store the value of a delay between
        the start of the system and the start of the recording
        (see https://mne.tools/stable/generated/mne.io.Raw.html#mne.io.Raw.first_samp).
        Taking this into account can be useful when extracting channels from the Raw object to
        detect events indices that are passed back to MNE again. When ``add_firstsamples`` is set to
        ``True``, the offset will be explicitly added at the beginning of the signal and filled with
        NaNs. If ``add_firstsamples`` is a float or an integer, the offset will filled with these
        values instead. If it is set to ``backfill``, will prepend with the first real value.

    Returns
    ----------
    DataFrame
        A DataFrame or Series containing the channel(s).
