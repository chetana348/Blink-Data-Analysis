    """**Fractal dimension via Power Spectral Density (PSD) slope**

    Fractal exponent can be computed from Power Spectral Density slope (PSDslope) analysis in
    signals characterized by a frequency power-law dependence.

    It first transforms the time series into the frequency domain, and breaks down the signal into
    sine and cosine waves of a particular amplitude that together "add-up" to represent the
    original signal.
    If there is a systematic relationship between the frequencies in the signal and the power of
    those frequencies, this will reveal itself in log-log coordinates as a linear relationship. The
    slope of the best fitting line is taken as an estimate of the fractal scaling exponent and can
    be converted to an estimate of the fractal dimension.

    A slope of 0 is consistent with white noise, and a slope of less than 0 but greater than -1,
    is consistent with pink noise i.e., 1/f noise. Spectral slopes as steep as -2 indicate
    fractional Brownian motion, the epitome of random walk processes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    method : str
        Method to estimate the fractal dimension from the slope,
        can be ``"voss1988"`` (default) or ``"hasselman2013"``.
    show : bool
        If True, returns the log-log plot of PSD versus frequency.
    **kwargs
        Other arguments to be passed to ``signal_psd()`` (such as ``method``).

    Returns
    ----------
    slope : float
        Estimate of the fractal dimension obtained from PSD slope analysis.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information regarding the parameters used
        to perform PSD slope analysis.

    Examples
    ----------
    .. ipython:: python

      import neurokit2 as nk

      # Simulate a Signal with Laplace Noise
      signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=2, sampling_rate=200, frequency=[5, 6], noise=0.5)

      # Compute the Fractal Dimension from PSD slope
      @savefig p_fractal_psdslope1.png scale=100%
      psdslope, info = nk.fractal_psdslope(signal, show=True)
      @suppress
      plt.close()

    .. ipython:: python
