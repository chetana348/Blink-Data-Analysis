    """**(Multifractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA or MFDFA)**

    Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is used to find long-term statistical dependencies in time
    series.

    For monofractal DFA, the output *alpha* :math:`\\alpha` corresponds to the slope of the linear
    trend between the scale factors and the fluctuations. For multifractal DFA, the slope values
    under different *q* values are actually generalised Hurst exponents *h*. Monofractal DFA
    corresponds to MFDFA with *q = 2*, and its output is actually an estimation of the
    **Hurst exponent** (:math:`h_{(2)}`).

    The Hurst exponent is the measure of long range autocorrelation of a signal, and
    :math:`h_{(2)} > 0.5` suggests the presence of long range correlation, while
    :math:`h_{(2)} < 0.5`suggests short range correlations. If :math:`h_{(2)} = 0.5`, it indicates
    uncorrelated indiscriminative fluctuations, i.e. a Brownian motion.

    .. figure:: ../img/douglas2022a.png
       :alt: Illustration of DFA (Douglas et al., 2022).

    Multifractal DFA returns the generalised Hurst exponents *h* for different values of *q*. It is
    converted to the multifractal **scaling exponent** *Tau* :math:`\\tau_{(q)}`, which non-linear
    relationship with *q* can indicate multifractility. From there, we derive the singularity
    exponent *H* (or :math:`\\alpha`) (also known as HÃ¶lder's exponents) and the singularity
    dimension *D* (or :math:`f(\\alpha)`). The variation of *D* with *H* is known as multifractal
    singularity spectrum (MSP), and usually has shape of an inverted parabola. It measures the long
    range correlation property of a signal. From these elements, different features are extracted:

    * **Width**: The width of the singularity spectrum, which quantifies the degree of the
      multifractality. In the case of monofractal signals, the MSP width is zero, since *h*\\(q) is
      independent of *q*.
    * **Peak**: The value of the singularity exponent *H* corresponding to the peak of
      singularity dimension *D*. It is a measure of the self-affinity of the signal, and a high
      value is an indicator of high degree of correlation between the data points. In the other
      words, the process is recurrent and repetitive.
    * **Mean**: The mean of the maximum and minimum values of singularity exponent *H*, which
      quantifies the average fluctuations of the signal.
    * **Max**: The value of singularity spectrum *D* corresponding to the maximum value of
      singularity exponent *H*, which indicates the maximum fluctuation of the signal.
    * **Delta**: the vertical distance between the singularity spectrum *D* where the singularity
      exponents are at their minimum and maximum. Corresponds to the range of fluctuations of the
      signal.
    * **Asymmetry**: The Asymmetric Ratio (AR) corresponds to the centrality of the peak of the
      spectrum. AR = 0.5 indicates that the multifractal spectrum is symmetric (Orozco-Duque et
      al., 2015).
    * **Fluctuation**: The *h*-fluctuation index (hFI) is defined as the power of the second
      derivative of *h*\\(q). See Orozco-Duque et al. (2015).
    * **Increment**: The cumulative function of the squared increments (:math:`\\alpha CF`) of the
      generalized Hurst's exponents between consecutive moment orders is a more robust index of the
      distribution of the generalized Hurst's exponents (Faini et al., 2021).

    This function can be called either via ``fractal_dfa()`` or ``complexity_dfa()``, and its
    multifractal variant can be directly accessed via ``fractal_mfdfa()`` or ``complexity_mfdfa()``.

    .. note ::

      Help is needed to implement the modified formula to compute the slope when
      *q* = 0. See for instance Faini et al. (2021). See https://github.com/LRydin/MFDFA/issues/33

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    scale : list
        A list containing the lengths of the windows (number of data points in each subseries) that
        the signal is divided into. Also referred to as Tau :math:`\\tau`. If ``"default"``, will
        set it to a logarithmic scale (so that each window scale has the same weight) with a
        minimum of 4 and maximum of a tenth of the length (to have more than 10 windows to
        calculate the average fluctuation).
    overlap : bool
        Defaults to ``True``, where the windows will have a 50% overlap with each other, otherwise
        non-overlapping windows will be used.
    integrate : bool
        It is common practice to convert the signal to a random walk (i.e., detrend and integrate,
        which corresponds to the signal 'profile') in order to avoid having too small exponent
        values. Note that it leads to the flattening of the signal, which can lead to the loss of
        some details (see Ihlen, 2012 for an explanation). Note that for strongly anticorrelated
        signals, this transformation should be applied  two times (i.e., provide
        ``np.cumsum(signal - np.mean(signal))`` instead of ``signal``).
    order : int
       The order of the polynomial trend for detrending. 1 corresponds to a linear detrending.
    multifractal : bool
        If ``True``, compute Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA), in which case the
        argument ``q`` is taken into account.
    q : Union[int, list, np.array]
        The sequence of fractal exponents when ``multifractal=True``. Must be a sequence between
        -10 and 10 (note that zero will be removed, since the code does not converge there).
        Setting ``q = 2`` (default for DFA) gives a result of a standard DFA. For instance, Ihlen
        (2012) uses ``q = [-5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5]`` (default when for multifractal). In general,
        positive q moments amplify the contribution of fractal components with larger amplitude and
        negative q moments amplify the contribution of fractal with smaller amplitude (Kantelhardt
        et al., 2002).
    maxdfa : bool
        If ``True``, it will locate the knee of the fluctuations (using :func:`.find_knee`) and use
        that as a maximum scale value. It computes max. DFA (a similar method exists in
        :func:`entropy_rate`).
    show : bool
        Visualise the trend between the window size and the fluctuations.
    **kwargs : optional
        Currently not used.

    Returns
    ----------
    dfa : float or pd.DataFrame
        If ``multifractal`` is ``False``, one DFA value is returned for a single time series.
    parameters : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information regarding the parameters used
        to compute DFA. If ``multifractal`` is ``False``, the dictionary contains q value, a
        series of windows, fluctuations of each window and the
        slopes value of the log2(windows) versus log2(fluctuations) plot. If
        ``multifractal`` is ``True``, the dictionary additionally contains the
        parameters of the singularity spectrum.

    As we can see from the plot, the final value, corresponding to the slope of the red line,
    doesn't capture properly the relationship. We can adjust the *scale factors* to capture the
    fractality of short-term fluctuations.
