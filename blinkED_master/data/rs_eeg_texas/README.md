## Texas Resting-state EEG

22 subjects, 72 EEG Channels for a resting task of 8 mins with 4 mins of eyes closed and 4 mins of eyes open.

After completion of the EEG setup, participants underwent 8 min of resting state EEG recording while sitting quietly in a comfortable padded chair in a darkened room (4 min eyes open and 4 min eyes closed interleaved in 1-min intervals; eyes open/closed order was balanced across participants). (Due to a technical recording error, one participant only received 4 min of recording time.) Subjects were instructed to remain relaxed, yet alert and awake at all times during recording.
