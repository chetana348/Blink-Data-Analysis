You have no experience in computer science? You are afraid of code? You feel betrayed because you didn't expect to do programming in psychology studies? **Relax!** We got you covered.

This tutorial will provide you with all you need to know to dive into the wonderful world of scientific programming. The goal here is not become a programmer, or a software designer, but rather to be able to use the power of programming to get **scientific results**.



Setup
---------------

The first thing you will need is to **install Python** on your computer (see `here <https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/installation.html>`_). In fact, this includes **two things**, installing Python (the *language*), and an *environment* to be able to use it. For this tutorial, we will assume you have something that looks like `Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>`_ (called an IDE). But you can use `jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_, `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ or `anything else <https://www.guru99.com/python-ide-code-editor.html>`_, it doesn't really matter.

There is one important concept to understand here: the difference between the **CONSOLE** and the **EDITOR**. The editor is like a *cooking table* where you prepare your ingredients to make a dish, whereas the console is like the *oven*, you only open it to put the dish in it and get the result.

The process of writing code usually happens in the editor, which is basically a text editor (such as notepad), except that it automatically highlights the code (making it easy to see functions, numbers, etc.). Importantly, you can directly *execute* a line of code (which is equivalent to copy it and paste it the *console*).

For instance, try writing ``1+1`` somewhere in the file in the editor pane. Now if select the piece of code you just wrote, and press ``F9`` (or ``CTRL + ENTER``, or ``SHIFT + ENTER`` in VS Code), it will **execute it** (on Spyder, but the shortcut for running a line might be different in other IDEs).

As a result, you should see in the console the order that you gave and, below, its **output** (which is: ``2``).


Now that the distinction between where we write the code and where the output appears is clear, take some time to explore the settings and turn the editor background to **DARK**. *Why?* Because it's more comfortable for the eyes, but most importantly, because it's cool ðŸ˜Ž

**Congrats, you've become a programmer**, a wizard of the modern times.


You can now save the file (``CTRL + S``), which will be saved with a ``.py`` extension (i.e., a Python script). Try closing everything and reopening this file with the editor.


Variables
---------------

The most important concept of programming is **variables**, which is a fancy name for something that you already know. Do you remember, from your mathematics classes, the famous *x*, this placeholder for any value? Well, *x* was a variable, i.e., the name referring to some other thing.

.. note::
   Despite to what I just said, a variable in programming is not equivalent to a variable in statistics, in which it refers to some specific data (for instance, *age* is a variable and contains multiple observations). In programming, a variable is simply the name that we give to some entity, that could be anything.


We can *assign* a value to a *variable* using the ``=`` sign, for instance:

.. ipython:: python

    x = 2
    y = 3

Once we execute these two lines, Python will know that ``x`` refers to ``2``, and ``y`` to ``3``. We can now write:

.. ipython:: python

    print(x + y)

Which will print in the console the correct result.

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/Neurokit/master/docs/img/learnpython/learnpython_3.png

We can also store the output in a third variable:

.. ipython:: python

    x = 2
    y = 3
    anothervariable = x * y
    print(anothervariable)


Data types
-------------------------

The next important thing to have in mind is that variables have **types**. Basic types include **integers** (numbers without decimals), **floats** (numbers with decimals), **strings** (character text) and **booleans** (``True`` and ``False``). Depending on their type, the variables will not behave in the same way. For example, try:

.. ipython:: python

    print(1 + 2)
    print("1" + "2")

What happened here? Well, quotations (``"I am quoted"``) are used to represent **strings** (i.e., text). So in the second line, the numbers that we added were not numbers, but text. And when you add strings together in Python, it *concatenates* them.

One can change the type of a variable with the following:

.. ipython:: python

    int(1.0)  # transform the input to an integer
    float(1)  # transform the input to a float (decimal)
    str(1)  # transform the input into text

Also, here I used the hashtag symbol to **make comments**, i.e., writing stuff that won't be executed by Python. This is super useful to annotate each line of your code to remember what you do - and why you do it.

Types are often the source of many errors as they usually are **incompatible** between them. For instance, you cannot add a *number* (``int`` or ``float``) with a *character string*. For instance, try running ``3 + "a"``, it will throw a ``TypeError``.

.. ipython:: python
   :okexcept:

    3 + "a"

You can see that the message of this error is not as obscure as it seems. In fact, getting used to having and understanding error and warning messages is an central part of the programming experience!

Lists and dictionaries
------------------------

Two other important types are **lists** and **dictionaries**. You can think of them as **containers**, as they contain multiple variables. The main difference between them is that in a **list**, you access the individual elements that it contains **by its order** (for instance, *"give me the third one"*), whereas in a **dictionary**, you access an element by its name (also known as **key**), for example *"give me the element named A"*.

A list is created using square brackets, and a dictionary using curly brackets. Importantly, in a dictionary, you must specify a name to each element. Here's what it looks like:


.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    mydict = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}


Keep in mind that there are more types of containers, such as *arrays* and *dataframes*, that we will talk about later.

Basic indexing
--------------------

There's no point in storing elements in containers if we cannot access them later on. As mentioned earlier, we can access elements from a **dictionary** by its key within square brackets (note that here the square brackets don't mean *list*, just mean *within the previous container*).

.. ipython:: python

    mydict = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}
    x = mydict["B"]
    print(x)

**Exercice time!** If you have followed this tutorial so far, you should be able to guess what the following code will output:

.. ipython:: python

    mydict = {"1": 0, "2": 42, "x": 7}
    x = str(1 + 1)
    y = mydict[x]
    print(y)

**Answer**: If you guessed **42**, you're right, congrats! If you guessed **7**, you have likely confused the **variable** named ``x`` (which represents 1+1 converted to a character), with the character ``"x"``. And if you guessed **0**... what is wrong with you?



Indexing starts from 0
------------------------

As mentioned earlier, one can access elements from a list by its **order**. However, **and there is very important to remember** (the source of many beginner errors), in Python, **the order starts from 0**. That means that the **first element is the 0th**.

So if we want the 2nd element of the list, we have to ask for the 1th:

.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    x = mylist[1]
    print(x)



Control flow (if and else)
----------------------------

One important notion in programming is control flow. You want the code to do something different depending on a condition. For instance, if ``x`` is lower than 3, print "lower than 3". In Python, this is done as follows:



.. ipython:: python

    x = 2
    if x < 3:
        print("lower than 3")

One very important thing to notice is that the **if statement** corresponds to a "chunk" of code, as signified by the colon ``:``. The chunk is usually written below, and has to be **indented** (you can indent a line or a chunk of code by pressing the ``TAB`` key).

*What is indentation?*


.. code-block:: console

    this
        is
            indentation


This indentation must be consistent: usually one level of indentation corresponds to 4 spaces. Make sure you respect that throughout your script, as this is very important in Python. If you break the rule, it will throw an **error**. Try running the following:

.. ipython:: python
   :okexcept:

    if 2 < 3:
    print("lower than 3")


Finally, **if** statements can be followed by **else** statements, which takes care of what happens if the condition is not fulfilled:

.. ipython:: python

    x = 5
    if x < 3:
        print("lower")
   else:
       print("higher")


Again, note the **indentation** and how the **else** statement creates a new indented chunk.


For loops
----------

One of the most used concept is **loops**, and in particular **for loops**. Loops are chunks of code that will be run several times, until a condition is complete.

The **for loops** create a *variable* that will successively take all the values of a list (or other **iterable** types). Let's look at the code below:

.. ipython:: python

    for var in [1, 2, 3]:
        print("var = " + str(var))

Here, the **for loop** creates a variable (that we named `var`), that will successively take all the values of the provided list.


Functions
------------

Now that you know what a **variable** is, as well as the purpose of little things like **if**, **else**, **for**, etc., the last most common thing that you will find in code are **function** calls. In fact, we have already used some of them! Indeed, things like ``print()``, ``str()`` and ``int()`` were functions. And in fact, you've probably encountered them in secondary school mathematics! Remember *f(x)*?

One important thing about functions is that *most of the time* (not always though), it takes something **in**, and returns something **out**. It's like a **factory**, you give it some raw material and it outputs some transformed stuff.

For instance, let's say we want to transform a variable containing an ``integer`` into a character ``string``:

.. ipython:: python

    x = 3
    x = str(x)
    print(x)

As we can see, our ``str()`` function takes ``x`` as an input, and outputs the transformed version, that we can collect using the equal sign ``=`` and store in the ``x`` variable to **replace** its content.

Another useful function is ``range()``, that creates a sequence of integers, and is often used in combination with **for** loops. Remember our previous loop:

.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    for var in mylist:
        print(var)

We can re-write it using the ``range()`` function, to create a sequence of **length 3** (which will be from ``0`` to ``2``; remember that Python indexing starts from 0!), and extracting and printing all of the elements in the list:

.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in range(3):
        print(mylist[i])

You might say that this loop is a bit more complicated than the first version, it's true. But that's the beauty of programming, all things can be done in a near-infinite amount of ways, allowing for your creativity to be expressed.

**Exercice time!** Can you try making a loop so that we add ``1`` to each element of the list?

**Answer**:

.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in range(3):
        mylist[i] = mylist[i] + 1
    print(mylist)

If you understand what happened here, in this combination of lists, functions, loops and indexing, great! You are ready to move on.

Packages
-------------

Interestingly, Python alone does not include a lot of functions. **And that's also its strength**, because it allows to easily use functions developped by other people, that are stored in **packages** (or *modules*). A package is a collection of functions that can be downloaded and used in your code.

One of the most popular package is **numpy** (for *NUM* -erical *PY* -thon), including a lot of functions for maths and scientific programming. It is likely that this package is already **installed** on your Python distribution (note that to install a package in Python, you have to do that from outside Python, running for instance ``pip install numpy`` in your *console* - and not in Python). However, installing a package doesn't mean you can use it. In order to use a package, you have to **import it** (*load it*) in your script, before using it. This usually happens at the top of a Python file, like this:

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy


Once you have imported it (you have to run that line), you can use its functions. For instance, let's use the function to compute **square roots** included in this package:

.. ipython:: python

    x = numpy.sqrt(9)
    print(x)

You will notice that we have to first **write the package name**, and then a **dot**, and then the ``sqrt()`` function. Why is it like that? Imagine you load two packages, both having a function named ``sqrt()``. How would the program know which one to use? Here, it knows that it has to look for the ``sqrt()`` function in the ``numpy`` package.

You might think, *it's annoying to write the name of the package everytime*, especially if the package name is long. And this is why we sometimes use *aliases*. For instance, *numpy* is often loaded under the shortcut **np**, which makes it shorter to use:

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np

    x = np.sqrt(9)
    print(x)


Lists *vs.* vectors (arrays)
------------------------------

Packages can also add new **types**. One important type available through **numpy** is **arrays**.

In short, an array is a container, similar to a **list**. However, it can only contain one type of things inside (for instance, only *floats*, only *strings*, etc.) and can be multidimensional (imagine a 3D cube made of little cubes containing a value). If an array is one-dimensional (like a list, i.e., a sequence of elements), we can call it a **vector**.

A list can be converted to a vector using the ``array()`` function from the **numpy** package:

.. ipython:: python

    mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    myvector = np.array(mylist)
    print(myvector)


In signal processing, vectors are often used instead of lists to store the signal values, because they are more efficient and allow to do some cool stuff with it. For instance, remember our exercice above? In which we had to add ``1`` to each element of the list? Well using vectors, you can do this directly like this:

.. ipython:: python

    myvector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    myvector = myvector + 1
    print(myvector)

Indeed, vectors allow for *vectorized* operations, which means that any operation is propagated on each element of the vector. And that's very useful for signal processing :)



Conditional indexing
---------------------

Arrays can also be transformed in arrays of **booleans** (``True`` or ``False``) using a condition, for instance:

.. ipython:: python

    myvector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
    vector_of_bools = myvector <= 2  # <= means inferior OR equal
    print(vector_of_bools)

This returns a vector of the same length but filled with ``True`` (if the condition is respected) or ``False`` otherwise. And this new vector can be used as a **mask** to index and subset the original vector. For instance, we can select all the elements of the array that fulfills this condition:

.. ipython:: python

    myvector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
    mask = myvector <= 2
    subset = myvector[mask]
    print(subset)

Additionally, we can also modify a subset of values on the fly:

.. ipython:: python

    myvector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
    myvector[myvector <= 2] = 6
    print(myvector)

Here we assigned a new value ``6`` to all elements of the vector that respected the condition (were inferior or equal to 2).


Dataframes
------------


If you've followed everything until now, congrats! You're almost there. The last important type that we are going to see is **dataframes**. A dataframe is essentially a table with rows and columns. Often, the rows represent different **observations** and the columns different **variables**.

Dataframes are available in Python through the **pandas** package, another very used package, usually imported under the shortcut ``pd``. A dataframe can be constructed from a *dictionary*: the **key** will become the **variable name**, and the list or vector associated will become the **variable values**.

.. ipython:: python

    import pandas as pd

    # Create variables
    var1 = [1, 2, 3]
    var2 = [5, 6, 7]

    # Put them in a dict
    data = {"Variable1": var1, "Variable2": var2}

    # Convert this dict to a dataframe
    data = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)

    print(data)

This creates a dataframe with 3 rows (the observations) and 2 columns (the variables). One can access the variables by their name:

.. ipython:: python

    print(data["Variable1"])

Note that Python cares about the **case**: ``tHiS`` is not equivalent to ``ThIs`. And ``pd.DataFrame`` has to be written with the *D* and *F* in capital letters. This is another common source of beginner errors, so make sure you put capital letters at the right place.

Reading data
-------------

Now that you know how to create a dataframe in Python, note that you also use **pandas** to read data from a file (*.csv*, *excel*, etc.) by its *path*:

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_excel("C:/Users/Dumbledore/Desktop/myfile.xlsx")  # this is an example
    print(data)


Additionally, this can also read data directly from the internet! Try running the following:

.. ipython:: python

    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/master/data/bio_eventrelated_100hz.csv")
    print(data)


Next steps
------------

Now that you know the basis, and that you can distinguish between the different elements of Python code (functions calls, variables, etc.), we recommend that you dive in and try to follow our other examples and tutorials, that will show you some usages of Python to get something out of it.
